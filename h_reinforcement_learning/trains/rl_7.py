in complicated env we use nerual network in order to model 
different types of non-linear and complicated states.
in last trains we handle update parameter by our serlves 
but 
when when we use neural network the graph model will very complex and 
calculating the gradian for any weight will complex too caused backpropagation rules and chain rules.  
so we use the library to auto calculate gradian in neural netweork
and we just specify the objective function and use auto calculate weight with libs

one lib : torch
