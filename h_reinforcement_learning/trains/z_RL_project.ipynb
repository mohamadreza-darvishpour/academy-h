        "#Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, you will implement an algorithmic trading bot using reinforcement learning, specifically employing the actor-critic method with policy gradients. The primary goal is to develop a bot that can make profitable trading decisions by learning from historical financial data. The actor-critic architecture combines two neural networks: the actor, which decides the actions, and the critic, which evaluates those actions. We use simple multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for both networks, but in practice, recurrent networks (RNNs) are often preferred for their ability to handle time-series data more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will be working with the gym-trading-env package to simulate a trading environment. This environment provides various trading-related observations and actions, enabling the bot to learn and adapt its strategies. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://gym-trading-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of the trading environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this project focuses on a simplified implementation, it serves as a foundational step toward solving more complex, practical problems. Even if the final trading bot does not perform optimally, the experience gained from working with reinforcement learning algorithms and trading environments is invaluable. It introduces you to crucial tools and concepts that are widely used in both academic research and industry applications.\n"
